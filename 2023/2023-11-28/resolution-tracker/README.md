## New Years Resolution Tracker ðŸŽ‰
Create a class to track progress towards New Year's goals. Each goal should have a name and a target number (like hours to study, books to read). Include methods to add goals, log progress, and check if goals are met. Optionally, create a UI for users to leverage these methods.
